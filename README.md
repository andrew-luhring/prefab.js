##Project Goal

The goal of this project is to make it as easy as posible to create block based 3d assets. Prefab.js should have built in texturing support as well. Animations will be handled by external tools, such as Blender.

###Samples

The following 3d models was created in Blender. It took more time and effort than it should have as Blender is simply not designed to work with Blocks.
