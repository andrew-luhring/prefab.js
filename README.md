##Project Goal

The goal of this project is to make it as easy as posible to create block based 3d assets. Prefab.js should have built in texturing support as well. Animations will be handled by external tools, such as Blender.

As a personal challenge, I chose not to use the HTML for UI elements on this project. All rendering is done through WebGL. This may result in performance gains down the line.

###Technologies

* JavaScript
* WebGL
* NodeWebkit

###Samples

The following 3d models was created in Blender. It took more time and effort than it should have as Blender is simply not designed to work with Blocks.

##Current Status

This project is very early in development stages and should not be used yet.
